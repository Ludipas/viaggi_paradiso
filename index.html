  <h3> Hello world!
    Air travel is the most polluting form of mobility.It benefits of low or non-existent taxes due to lower fares have escaped international regulation which gives it a competitive advantage over other transportation modes.
Extra low price generate a paradoxical situation in which the most polluting is also the most accessible. We can now act through our daily choices but this situation is unsustainable and must evolve: how our way of living, requiring always faster work and exchanges, should change? How citizens habits should be shaped without mortifiyng them? Now that we have knowledge will we take action for a small or big change?/even if the damage begun a long time ago and we knew it, why we didnâ€™t do or
ask any change?
